## Setup

Starting the project:

1. Run `npm install` in your terminal.
2. Run `json-server --watch db.json --port 8000`. This will run your backend on port `8000`.
3. In a new terminal, run `npm start`. This will run your React app on port `3000`.

Make sure to open
[http://localhost:8001/transactions](http://localhost:8001/transactions) in the
browser to verify that your backend is working before you proceed!
